// T4 code generation is enabled for model 'D:\Zan_Tun_Khine\SA47\SA4102 ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT\ESNet\ESNET_CA\GitHubRepo_6\Team5BLibraryManagementSystem\SA47Team05BESNETLMS.edmx'. 
// To enable legacy code generation, change the value of the 'Code Generation Strategy' designer
// property to 'Legacy ObjectContext'. This property is available in the Properties Window when the model
// is open in the designer.

// If no context and entity classes have been generated, it may be because you created an empty model but
// have not yet chosen which version of Entity Framework to use. To generate a context class and entity
// classes for your model, open the model in the designer, right-click on the designer surface, and
// select 'Update Model from Database...', 'Generate Database from Model...', or 'Add Code Generation
// Item...'.
